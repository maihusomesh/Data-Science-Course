# Shreiyans AI Data Science

This website is designed to provide a gamified, structured learning path for data science. It's built to feel like a retro-style command-line interface, providing a unique and engaging user experience.

## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### Homepage
When you first arrive, the page will have a minimalist design. The hero section, which takes up the full screen, will display a large, central "Hello User..." message, giving the impression of a command-line welcome. The rest of the content is hidden, encouraging a focused initial experience.

The header remains fixed at the top, allowing for quick navigation to other sections like "My Dashboard" and "About Me" and providing a consistent presence.

### Roadmap Section
As you scroll down, the roadmap section appears. It is designed to visually guide you through the learning journey.

Step 1 is a video placeholder, where the core curriculum or a foundational video would be embedded. The user is prompted to watch this video to understand the course's overall structure.

Step 2 is where the gamification elements come in. This section would feature a visually engaging "game-like" advertisement for the course, complete with a progress bar and XP, to make learning feel rewarding. A "Start" button would initiate the course, leading the user into the first interactive lesson.

### About Me Section
This section serves as a personal touch, where the creator can share their story and the motivation behind building the website. It provides context and builds trust with the user, explaining the purpose of the project beyond just a simple learning platform.

### Future Functionality
The navigation link "My Dashboard" will lead to a new page that is currently not part of the website's initial build. In the future, this page could include:

*   A user profile with a profile picture.
*   Progress tracking to show completed lessons and modules.
*   Achievement badges for completing milestones in the course.
*   A leaderboard to show how the user's progress compares to other users.

### Footer
The website also has a simple footer that includes a copyright notice and social media icons. This provides a professional and complete look to the website. The footer will be consistently visible at the bottom of every page.
